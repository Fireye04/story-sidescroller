# Ideas

## Themes

### Gender Dysphoria

How it feels to 
- hate your body
- deal with people who'd rather you didn't have human rights
- deal with people who are cool with supporting the people above (hi jason)
- experience real happiness with your own identity for the first time ever

### Social Isolation

What do you do when there's no one to lean on?

Perhaps has an ending where the main character can find a community if they try hard enough.

### Self harm

Hey look an outlet for my depression! Oh wait that's not healthy. Fuck.

## Mechanics

### Environmental interaction
A-la night in the woods

Giving moody vibes and some internalization for the protagonist

### Button mashing

*Don't punch the mirror don't punch the mirror don't punch the mirror*

### Resource management

Bread and butter of the game; further splits dialogue trees and allows choices to have wider impact on play.

#### Resources

- Spoons (motivation)
- Grades
- Creativity
- Happiness

### Clothing system
Feeds into the Resources system. I want wearing your dysphoria hoodie™ to have a mechanical impact.

(optional) add more clothes & stat bonuses!

Stuff like 
- soak (eg: -3 happiness and 1 happiness soak becomes -2) only applies to negative mods, cannot become positive **MAKES NEGATIVE LESS NEGATIVE**
- boost (eg: +2 spoons and 1 spoon boost becomes +3) only applies to positive mods **MAKES POSITIVE MORE POSITIVE**
- drain (eg: +1 grades and 1 grades drain becomes +0) only applies to positive mods, cannot become negative **MAKES POSITIVE LESS POSITIVE**
- leak (eg: -2 creativity and 1 creativity leak becomes -3) only applies to negative mods **MAKES NEGATIVE MORE NEGATIVE**

__boils down to soak vs leak and boost vs drain on each kind of resource__


Most simple, default outfit, optional dysphoria hoodie™, fem outfit.
- Hoodie:
    - Adds 2 soak to grades and spoons but 1 drain on creativity and Happiness
    - Narrative effects: mostly nothing, some casual mockery
- fem outfit
    - 4 boost to happiness, 2 boost to grades and creativity, 2 soak to spoons
    - Narrative effects: hell on earth <3

## Locations

### Home
What's a good trauma dump without some transphobic parents and an unstable home environment?

### Hideout
Perhaps a treehouse of sorts? 

Project for the protagonist to complete?

Spots to hide fem clothes perhaps?

### School

Keep your head down, get your homework in on time, and work on diagramming your treehouse, and maybe they won't notice you. 

### (optional) Mall

Functionally serves as a way to get clothes, which feeds into that clothes mechanic.

(Optional) mechanics to boost clothes' stats when shopping with friends (assuming you figure out what those are at some point)
